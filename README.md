# motr.js

motr.js is a collection of jQuery plugins designed to do two basic things:

1. Provide common functionality such as text editing, and form validation

2. Provide "native" updates to things such as forms and media elements to create browser consistent fields like number and range, and add support for html5 validation with ValidityStates.

All plugins are tested against recent versions of Chrome, Safari, and Firefox, as well as IE8 and 9. IE7 is also tested, and when at all possible supported.
